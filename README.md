HelpScout Experiments
=========================

Every now and then I need to whip up some custom JavaScript to look into some [HelpScout](http://www.helpscout.net/) metric or aspect that is not in the UI necessarily. I took one of those and made it available for others. Feel free to use it on the [Github Page]() or just clone the repository and use it offline.
